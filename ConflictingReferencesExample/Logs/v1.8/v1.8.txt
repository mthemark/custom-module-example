#It seems that decisions DecisionsSDK 8.16.0 references version 4.9.0.0 of System.ServiceModel.Http.dll that is included as a reference on the custom module also,
# downgrading to the 4.9 version allows the module to run 
# but that version has  CVE-2021-24112 ".NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" on System.Drawing.Common 5.0.0(https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxg9-xrhp-64gj)
# and CVE-2022-34716 ".NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability" on System.Security.Cryptography.Xml 5.0.0 (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh55-786g-wjwj)
#
#If I upgrading the System.ServiceModel.Http to any other version I get this following error...
#Cannot start because of a conflicting dll: C:\Program Files\Decisions\Decisions Server\Modules\ConflictingReferencesExamplev1.8\ReferenceDlls\System.ServiceModel.Http.dll
#
# After upgrading the transitive packages as follows
#  System.Drawing.Common --> 6.0.0
#  System.Security.Cryptography.Xml --> 8.0.0
# 
# then I get another CVE
# System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs 5.0.0 has CVE-2023-29331 ".NET Denial of Service vulnerability" (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-555c-2p6r-68mm)
# If I upgrade this transitive package to 8.0.0
# 
# then the following are used by the custom module
# 
# System.Drawing.Common.dll (6.0.0) 6.0.0+4822e3c3aa77eb82b2fb33c9321f923cf11ddde6 6.0.21.52210
# System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.dll (8.0.0) 8.0.0+5535e31a712343a63f5d7d796cd874e563e5ac14 8.0.23.53103
# System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.dll (8.0.0) 8.0.0+5535e31a712343a63f5d7d796cd874e563e5ac14 8.0.23.53103
# System.Private.ServiceModel.dll (4.9.0) 3.3.0 4.900.21.52002

This fixes the CVE issues with using the old System.ServiceModel.Http.dll 4.9.0 locally.

Suggestions for decisions SDK developers.
It would be good if the DecisionsSDK package included the transitive packages it uses.
Also upgrading the System.ServiceModel related packages to newer non-CVE affected versions i.e. 6.2.0 (DecisionsSDK 8.16.0) / 8.0.0 (DecisionsSDK 8.17.0+).
